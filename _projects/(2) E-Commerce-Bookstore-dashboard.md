</div>

1. In this dashboard i use five scorecard to show the total number of authors, the total number of title, the total number of languages, the total number of publishers, and the total number of reviews.
2. After that I use three time series chart to show the number of books published each year, the total number of reviews each years, and the average rating each year. 
  -	From the first chart the audience can find out that the number of books published increasing every year until 2021 but decreased in 2022.
  -	The second chart tell to the audience that the total reviews increasing every years until 2019, this is in line with the increasing number of books being published every years until 2019. But after that the total review being decreased until 2021 This is in contrast to the increasing number of books published until 2021.
  -	The third chart show that the average rating tends to increase every year until 2019 and after that being decreased until 2022, this is in line with the total reviews. 
3. And then i use table with bars and heatmap to show the details of each author based on the number of books written. In this table also show the total reviews and the average of rating that every authors gets.
4. I also use table with heatmap to show how many books are published by each publisher and in order from the most. And also I use table with bars and heatmap to show how many books use cover and paper type for each cover and paper combination and also show the average price and discount price for each cover and paper combination.
5. After that I use combo chart to show the comparison of ratings and reviews of each title, ordered by review. So the audience can see which books are often reviewed by people and can also see the ratings for the books whether it is good or bad.
6. I also use bubble chart to show the correlation between rating, price, and total books. This chart tell that the book with the best rating has the most number of books, and also the book with the best rating has an average price which is quite expensive and also has the highest number of books.
